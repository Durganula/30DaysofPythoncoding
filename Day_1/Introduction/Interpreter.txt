>> How does interpreter works in python ?
The Python interpreter is CPython and is written in the C programming language. 
So how does CPython work?

1. First, the interpreter checks or analyzes the source code. 
By now, we assume you know what the source code means.
 It’s the high-level language you write programs in.

2.So, CPython receives the source code and initializes several commands to do some vital things.

First, the interpreter ensures you follow Python’s syntax for writing code.

It also checks for incorrect lines of code. If it encounters any error in a line, it stops the program from running and produces an error message.

This analysis divides the source code files into a list of tokens.

3. Then interpreter generates a byte code which can be stored in .pyc extension

4. Next interpreter initializes a python virtual machine which converts byte code
in to a machine code (binary code)
